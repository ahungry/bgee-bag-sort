# BGEE (Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition) Bag Sort

In playing BGEE, I'm a bit of an item hoarder.

As such, this can make it really difficult to find items in the
bottomless bag of holding added by some mods.

The aim of this tool is to decompress/parse a .sav game file, re-order
the items in a bag (.sto resource), and re-compress into a valid .sav
game file.
